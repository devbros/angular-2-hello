# angular-2-hello
Basic hello world extended to use data binding, simple todo list using a service class.

Uses version 2.0.0-alpha.19

## demo
Example <a href="http://simonharding.net/ang2/hello-world/dist/">here</a>

##notes
rather redundant decorator was included to check keyup but wasnt working.. possibly due to the binding not working in a raised bug.

colour names are fun, too.
